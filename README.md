# LigthFlix-HTML-CSS-only

## About
*This is the first exercise and the first contact touch with web development on the KeepCoding Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp.*
**We could only use HTML and CSS only**, no frameworks, no copy-pasted code or anything like that.
It's about making a simple version of any multi-media streaming web-app, -like Netflix on my case-.
